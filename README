  These are my dotfiles. There are many like them,
  but these ones are mine.

  Everything here is optimized first and foremost for
  efficiency and low-latency.
  
    * We don't run git commands in the shell prompt.
    * We don't use 'Oh My Zsh' or such filth which results in slow systems.
    * We don't use pointless plugins like vim powerline.
    * We avoid slow or bloated software such as bash and xterm.

  The environment is based around the following programs:

    * `st` as the terminal emulator. It's small and fast as fuck.
    * `dvtm` to manage the scrollback buffer.
    * `xmonad` as the window manager. There are also settings for `dwm`.
    * `zsh` as the shell.
    * `dmenu` as the launcher.
    * `xmobar` as the status bar.
    * `vim` and `neovim` as the editors.

  To install:

    1. Change your login shell to zsh:

        $ chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

    2. Copy all files to ~.
